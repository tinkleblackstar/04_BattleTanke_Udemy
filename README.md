Part of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount)!
This is my BattleTank Project as a part of said course.

Battle Tank is an action game where players destroy eachother in a Deathmatch type of game in an open landscape environment. It's a 3D game. Last man standing wins. 

* I will Create a landscape where in the Tanks will Move, and hopefully design it to allow for fun tactical play. Both For Singleplayer vs AI or Multiplayer. 

* Interesting assets, to hide behind such as walls/houses or other realistic objects which could be found on a battlefield. 

* Sound such as Shooting, explosion and tank hit. Movement sound (engine) from the tank aswell as a special sound from rotating the top(Turret)

* 3d models. Tank and said assets, landscape environment with "realistic" foilage, materials and Textures. 

* UI Menu, playgame, Singleplyer/multiplayer. Buttons. 

* 2d Images of shells or other avilible weapons to switch between while in the game
